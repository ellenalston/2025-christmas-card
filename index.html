            Her due date is 2/4/26, surrounded by many other family birthdays. Ellen is healthy, and
            baby is healthy too. We pray for a safe and happy delivery, and we feel your outpouring of
            love and excitement for our growing family.

            Ellen and I have been working at Northstar Café and Bar in Shaker Heights as a side hustle and way
            to connect to our neighborhood. We love our co-workers and managers, as well as the incredibly kind
            guests who are always asking how Ellen is feeling and sharing in our joy and excitement. Although
            Ellen will be leaving this month to focus on resting, we have definitely found a Northstar
            family there.

            Speaking of food, Ellen and I have relished the opportunity to visit some yummy restaurants in the

            us chattering gleefully while exploring the chef’s tasting menu.

            Moving into the career side of things, Ellen accomplished a massive feat — getting a job for a tech
            company as a software engineer (In fact, she designed this whole letter.)! She still keeps her Music Therapy license current and will always hold
            that era close to her heart. I am so proud of her for taking this courageous leap!

            At Progressive, in addition to receiving an promotion this year, I’ve embraced getting involved in the DEI space. Some highlights include hosting
            quarterly volunteer events at places like The Kid’s Book Bank and Cleveland Metroparks, marching in the
            Memorial Day and Pride Parades, and most recently, giving a speech at our annual Keys to Progress event,
            where I spoke on behalf of one of the lucky recipients, an Air Force veteran named Akeba, to whom we
            gifted a 2023 Ford Edge SUV!

            In the midst of our busy schedule, I was able to team up with a good friend of ours and fellow musician,
            Maggie, where we took silver in 4.5 Mixed Doubles at a professionally hosted pickleball tournament in
            Columbus! Standing on that podium was a memory I will not soon forget, and Ellen was the perfect
            cheerleader, sideline snack-getter, and sports psychologist to her jittery husband.

            Now, Lillian will most certainly be taking up most of our time and attention when she arrives. A Babymoon

            We saw two spectacular Broadway performances: <em>Oh Mary!</em> and <em>Wicked</em>. Other highlights of this

            unfinished Klimt’s up close at Cafe Sabarsky, an al fresco lunch in the middle of Central Park at Tavern on
            the Green, and relaxing and enjoying the cityscape views our gorgeous hotel room had to offer.
